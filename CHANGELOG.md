# CHANGELOG

Newest first. One entry per change you push. Keep it plain:
what changed, which file, and why. This is how a fresh session (and future you)
knows the current state without re-reading every file.

Format:
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
- file(s) touched
- what changed and why
- any Webflow-side change needed (new attribute, head snippet, etc.)
```

## 2026-08-14 — Docs brought in line with the code and the new hosting
- ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md § transition.js now documents the shell-persistence machinery:
  the leave placeholder, syncShellClasses' two passes, isInjected filtering, and the
  hard rules (never match by class; mark injected nodes with an ATTRIBUTE; counts must
  be equal, never Math.min; <body> is the Barba wrapper so never anchor a positional
  walk there; shell structure must match across pages).
- CLAUDE.md: fixed two stale lines (jsDelivr → Cloudflare Workers; dropped the
  "pasting to CodeSandbox" instruction) and added the shell-persistence gotchas.
- No code change.

## 2026-08-14 — Class sync: anchor on ancestor chains, not sibling position (v1.0.5)
- src/transition.js, src/glass.js, src/slider.js, src/flexicare-selfie.js
- Symptom: v1.0.4's count-equality guard fired at the WRAPPER root (16 live children
  vs 15), so it bailed immediately and no classes synced at all — the 1.5rem nav gap
  came back.
- Cause: data-barba="wrapper" is on <body>, and glass.js appends its <svg> defs holder
  there. Any body-level injected node guarantees a count mismatch at the root, which
  under the guard means "sync nothing".
- Fix, pass 1: syncAncestors() walks UP from anchors carrying a unique attribute
  (container, [data-barba-sync], [data-nav-reveal], [data-show-except],
  [data-progress-bar]) copying classes along the ancestor chain. Walking upward never
  looks at siblings, so injected nodes cannot affect it. This is what fixes the shell.
- Fix, pass 2: the guarded positional walk now starts at the CONTAINER'S PARENT rather
  than the wrapper, so it still catches persistent siblings like top-section-wrapper
  without being killed by body-level injections.
- All script-injected nodes are now marked with attributes (data-lg-defs on glass's
  svg, data-js-injected on the tuner fab/panel and the selfie file input) and filtered
  via isInjected(). Attributes, not classes — the sync rewrites classNames.
- No Webflow change needed.

## 2026-08-14 — Fix blank band above content caused by class-sync misalignment (v1.0.4)
- src/transition.js, src/glass.js
- Symptom (regression from v1.0.3): after navigating, an empty div with class
  padding-global appeared above the content, adding a large blank band. Gone on refresh.
- Cause: glass.js inserts <div class="lg-layer"> as the FIRST child of every glassed
  element. That node exists in the live DOM but not in the parsed next document, so
  inside glass-background-container the live children were [lg-layer, padding-global]
  against [padding-global]. walkShellClasses matched by Math.min and paired
  lg-layer <-> padding-global, copying padding-global's class onto the glass overlay.
- Fix: matchableKids() now also drops glass overlays, and walkShellClasses() REQUIRES
  the two child counts to be equal — a mismatch abandons that branch (stale classes)
  instead of misaligning. Math.min was the real defect: it let a length mismatch
  silently shift every later sibling.
- glass.js now tags the overlay with data-lg-layer as well as .lg-layer, because the
  class sync overwrites classNames and a class is not a dependable marker.
- No Webflow change needed.

## 2026-08-14 — Sync persistent shell classes across navigations (v1.0.3)
- src/transition.js
- Symptom: the 1.5rem flex gap above button-navigation-wrapper was missing after
  navigating, but correct after a hard refresh.
- Cause: Barba only swaps the container. The shell around it persists as whatever
  the FIRST loaded page shipped, so per-page CLASSES on it go stale. Landing on the
  site root left the shell as landing-glass-container (gap 0, justify-content
  center) on pages whose own markup says glass-container (gap 24px, flex-start).
  A refresh "fixed" it only because Webflow then served the correct shell.
- Fix: syncShellClasses() walks the persistent tree on each navigation and copies
  each element's class list from its positional counterpart in the next page's
  document. Skips the container subtree (Barba owns it) and [data-barba-sync]
  subtrees (innerHTML swap owns those, and their buttons carry runtime state
  classes). Containers are excluded from positional matching because two exist
  mid-transition. Abandons a branch on tagName mismatch rather than guessing.
- No Webflow change needed. REQUIREMENT: keep the shell's STRUCTURE identical
  across pages (same nesting and element order) — only classes may differ.

## 2026-08-13 — Fix persistent siblings snapping during page transitions (v1.0.1)
- src/transition.js
- Barba inserts the next container only AFTER leave() resolves, but beginOverlap()
  pulled the leaving container out of flow at the START of leave(). For the length
  of the leave animation the shared parent (content-flex-wrapper) had a hole in it,
  so persistent siblings — top-section-wrapper above the container — reflowed into
  the vacated space and snapped back when the next container landed.
- beginOverlap() now parks a rigid, hidden placeholder (same box + margins,
  flex:0 0 auto) in the container's slot; beforeEnter() removes it the moment the
  real container is inserted. endOverlap() removes it as a backstop.
- No Webflow change needed. The placeholder carries data-barba-placeholder for
  debugging only.
- Also added _headers (Cloudflare cache rules) as part of moving hosting
  off pinned jsDelivr tags — see docs/hosting-and-publishing.md.

## 2026-08-13 — Hosting moves to Cloudflare Workers; no more footer pastes
- Added _headers, wrangler.jsonc, .assetsignore
- Renamed docs/git-and-jsdelivr.md → docs/hosting-and-publishing.md and rewrote it
- Updated CLAUDE.md + README.md to describe the new workflow
- Why: pinned jsDelivr tags meant pasting a new footer into Webflow on every
  release. Unpinning was not an option — jsDelivr serves unpinned URLs with
  max-age=604800, so returning visitors would hold stale JS for 7 days.
- Now: Cloudflare Workers serves the repo root from main, with
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate on /src/* — push and it's live.
- WEBFLOW CHANGE (one time): footer script URLs move from
  cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KentonVos/flexicare@vX.Y.Z/src/... to
  https://flexicare.kenton-323.workers.dev/src/... — same files, same order.
  After this paste, the footer only changes if the file LIST changes.
- main is now live on every push. Version tags still cut as a rollback escape hatch.

## 2025-08-13 — Set up repo, context docs, and move hosting to Git + jsDelivr
- Added CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, this CHANGELOG, .gitignore
- Captured the real Webflow head snippet in docs/webflow-head-snippet.md
- Added docs/git-and-jsdelivr.md (setup + publish + rollback)
- Moved the nine scripts into src/ as the source of truth
- Hosting moves from CodeSandbox to jsDelivr (served from GitHub, version-tagged)
- No script behaviour changed; footer URLs change to cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/USERNAME/flexicare@vX.Y.Z/src/...
- Webflow footer: moved dev-only slider.js (tuner) to the end; order otherwise unchanged (verified correct)
