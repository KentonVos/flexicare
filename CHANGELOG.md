# CHANGELOG

Newest first. One entry per change you push to CodeSandbox. Keep it plain:
what changed, which file, and why. This is how a fresh session (and future you)
knows the current state without re-reading every file.

Format:
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
- file(s) touched
- what changed and why
- any Webflow-side change needed (new attribute, head snippet, etc.)
```

## 2025-08-13 — Set up repo, context docs, and move hosting to Git + jsDelivr
- Added CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, this CHANGELOG, .gitignore
- Captured the real Webflow head snippet in docs/webflow-head-snippet.md
- Added docs/git-and-jsdelivr.md (setup + publish + rollback)
- Moved the nine scripts into src/ as the source of truth
- Hosting moves from CodeSandbox to jsDelivr (served from GitHub, version-tagged)
- No script behaviour changed; footer URLs change to cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/USERNAME/flexicare@vX.Y.Z/src/...
- Webflow footer: moved dev-only slider.js (tuner) to the end; order otherwise unchanged (verified correct)
